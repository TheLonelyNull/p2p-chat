# p2p-chat
Most modern apps track their users to some extent. Even if a chat application states that chats are end-to-end encrypted there is very little said about what other personal data the app might store. A decentralized solution overcomes most of these problems.

This application is a peer-to-peer alternative for popular chat applications like WhatsApp and Telegram. Although Skype already implements a somewhat peer-to-peer system, there are still login and other servers. This application aims to be fully decentralized with nodes all having the same priority and working together to dynamically manage the network.
