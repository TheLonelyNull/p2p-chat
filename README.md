# p2p-chat
A peer-to-peer alternative for popular chat applications like WhatsApp and Telegram. Although Skype already implements a somewhat peer-to-peer system, there are still login and other servers. This application aims to be fully decentralized with nodes all having the same priority and working together to dynamically manage the network.
